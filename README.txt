OPSWAT Coding Challenge
Applicant name: Kevin Yin

For this application, I used Python version 3.6.4, but it should work with older version of python as well.
Ubuntu 16.04 ships with Python 3 pre-installed, so everything should be set up already!
Here are a list of instructions for setting up and updating the python environment on Ubuntu, if needed:

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-ubuntu-16-04

The only non-native library I use is requests, which should be downloaded already. If not, install with this line:

pip install requests

To run, make sure to fill in the API key variable at the top of the file, and then simply go to the folder where the file is located and
insert the file you want to scan. Then, type in the following on the command line:

python3 opswat.py upload_file filename.txt

If there are any questions about my program, feel free to send me an email at yinkevin8@gmail.com.
Thank you to the team at OPSWAT for this opportunity!
